<p>My name is Siddartha Devic, but I usually go by Sid. I am an undergraduate at The University of Texas at Dallas, double majoring in mathematics and computer science. I am (I think) broadly interested in machine learning and theoretical computer science. I made this blog to post about interesting things I have found, made, or want to learn.</p>

<h3 style=" text-align: center;" id="my-life">My life</h3>

<p>I’ve had a pretty normal life, but I rolled very abnormal starting conditions. My Dad is from Croatia, and my Mom is from Nepal; needless to say I was very confused about my ethnicity growing up. Actually, I still am confused. I graduated from Westwood high school in 2017, and am planning on graduating from UTD in 2021. My dream is to attend graduate school and pursue a PhD in computer science! (Wish me luck) After that… well, let’s see that happen first.</p>

<h3 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h3>
<p>I enjoy playing classical piano, go, and the occasional video game. I also love reading novels and articles, and have been reading a lot of Haruki Murakami recently.</p>

  <p>Wow, you really needed to include a quote from your favorite author like all those other blogs? Really?</p>

  <p><em>Me</em></p>
