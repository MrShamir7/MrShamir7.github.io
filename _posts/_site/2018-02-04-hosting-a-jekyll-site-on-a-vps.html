<p>As I was trying to set up this blog, I ran into some issues regarding running Jekyll, a static site builder, and wanted to write a short post helping anyone attempting the same configuration that I was shooting for.</p>

<p>I began with my digital ocean hosted VPS (which, for students using the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">github student dev pack</a>, offers $60 of hosting credit) with Apache2, as I haven’t been exposed to much nginx.</p>

<p>My goal was to get a modifiable jekyll repo on my local machine that I could update posts/blog with. I wanted to work on my local machine, in case I didn’t have internet/connection to my server, and then push changes to my VPS and github.</p>

<p>So we need three things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A local git repo</li>
  <li>A github repo</li>
  <li>A remote repo on our VPS</li>
</ol>

<p>We can begin by installing jekyll and it’s dependencies on both our remote and local machine:</p>
