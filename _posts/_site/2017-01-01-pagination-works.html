<blockquote>
  <p>Pagination is the process of dividing a document into discrete pages, either electronic pages or printed pages.</p>

  <p>In reference to books produced without a computer, pagination can mean the consecutive page numbering to indicate the proper order of the pages, which was rarely found in documents pre-dating 1500, and only became common practice c. 1550, when it replaced foliation, which numbered only the front sides of folios.</p>
