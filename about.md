### About Me

My name is Siddartha Devic, but I usually go by sid. I am an undergraduate at The University of Texas at Dallas, double majoring in mathematics and computer science. I am broadly interested in machine learning and theoretical computer science. I made this blog to post about interesting things I have found, made, or want to learn.

### My life

I graduated from Westwood high school in 2017, and am going to graduate from UTD in 2021. 


### Hobbies
I enjoy playing classical piano, go, and the occasional video game. I also love reading novels and articles, and have been reading a lot of Haruki Murakami recently. An interesting article someone recently sent me is [this](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/), an almost "novelized" account of the creation of the so-called "Silk Road".
