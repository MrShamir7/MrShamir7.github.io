### About Me

I am an undergraduate at The University of Texas at Dallas, double majoring in mathematics and computer science. I am broadly interested in machine learning and theoretical computer science.

### My life

I graduated from Westwood high school in 2017, and am going to graduate from UTD in 2021. 


### Hobbies
I enjoy playing classical piano, go, and the occasional video game. I also enjoy reading novels, and have recently been reading a lot of Haruki Murakami.
